# CodeAlpha_HangmanGame
A simple text-based Hangman game created for the CodeAlpha internship. This Python project demonstrates core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and string manipulation by implementing the classic word-guessing game. The player has 6 attempts to guess the hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time.
